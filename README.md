## Objectives
This project aims to build a web-based AI research and interaction portal that showcases cutting-edge developments in quantum computing, enhanced with natural language capabilities. By integrating arXivâ€™s quantum research categories, the system allows users to explore, search, and interact with scientific content through an intelligent conversational interface powered by OpenAI. The platform also includes 3D visualization of quantum hardware assets via Three.js, enabling an immersive learning experience. Key objectives include efficient data retrieval, local caching, AI-powered query understanding, and a scalable foundation for interactive research tools.
